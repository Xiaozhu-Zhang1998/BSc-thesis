# BSc-thesis

- Chapter 1 gives an overview of the research backgrounds and introduces several objectives of this thesis.
- Chapter 2 describes the Cox’s proportional hazards model, the graphic structures, the Laplacian penalties, and the adaptive method.
- Chapter 3 derives a coordinate descent algorithm for the graph-incorporated adaptive Lasso (GLasso) for Cox’s PH model.
- Chapter 4 proves the covariance, the grouping effect, the consistency and Oracle properties of the estimator; it also gives two significance tests.
- Chapter 5 performs simulations to compare the performances between GLasso (or aGLasso) and other regularization procedures.
- Chapter 6 applies the GLasso (or aGLasso) procedure to the identification and monitoring of financial crisis of listed companies in a certain market.
